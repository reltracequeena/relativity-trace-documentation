## Overview
When reviewing a communication in the Viewer, a user can manually log (code) their review decision on the coding layout. Each user's coding layout will be unique to their organizations requirements and processes, which will be determined during implementation. Coding layouts can also be different based on the user, the type of communication, or the review level the document is at. Default coding decisions can be specified by administrator to reduce the amount of time necessary for reviewers to code documents ([more information]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/review/auto_coding.md %})). Once a decision has been made on a document the appropriate actions will be taken on that document to move it through the organization specific workflow. More information on Layouts can be found [here](https://help.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/Relativity/Layouts/Layouts.htm?Highlight=layouts).
