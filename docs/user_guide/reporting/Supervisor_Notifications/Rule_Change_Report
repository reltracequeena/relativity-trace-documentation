## Overview
All clients have similar reporting needs and have stakeholders who are not in Trace daily. The goal of this feature is to provide clients an easily configurable method of recieving email alerts when a certain action occurs.  

### Rule Change Report
Companies must track the status of alert rules. The goal is to Generate a report, that can also be sent via email, when a change is made to a rule so that compliance can monitor those who have permissions to update controls for any types of misconduct. The following are steps on how to view this feature, please see the admin guide on how to enable this.

1. Search Previously Generated Reports ![](media/notifications/Supervisor_Notification/Rule_Change_Report/Rule Change Report Search.png)
