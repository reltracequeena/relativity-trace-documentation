## Overview
All clients have similar reporting needs and have stakeholders who are not in Trace daily. The goal of this feature is to provide clients an easily configurable method of recieving email alerts when a certain action occurs.  

### Non-Alerted Document Review Report
Companies can track when surveillance team members view communications that have not been alerted on to identify scenarios where compliance team members are abusing their access to view employees communications. Trace will send an email report or real-time notifications regarding these privacy issues where reviewers are looking at non-alerted documents. 
The following are steps on how to view this feature, please see the admin guide on how to enable this.

1. Search Previously Generated Reports ![](media/notifications/Non_Alerted_Document_Report/Non-Alerted Doc Reports Tab in Setup v2.png)
