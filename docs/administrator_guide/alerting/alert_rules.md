## Highlighting

By default, Trace creates a `Trace Rules Persistent Highlight Set` that highlights Trace Terms currently associated with any Rule. If you would like to highlight Trace Terms that are not associated with any Rule, you create additional Persistent Highlight Set as needed.

In addition, you can override default highlight color scheme (magenta background and black text) for a specific Trace Term by specifying a semi-colon separated list of pre-configured color combinations. The details of the color codes can be accessed via Context Help button on the Term Definition page.

Please look to the [User Guide Alerting Documentation](https://relativitydev.github.io/relativity-trace-documentation/docs/user_guide/alerting/) for documentation related to implementation.
