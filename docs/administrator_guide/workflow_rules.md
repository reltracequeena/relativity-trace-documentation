## Overview
Workflow Rules operate similarily to Alert Rules, although they don't generate alerts for users to review. Rather workflow rules trigger an action. To find more information on how to configure Workflow Rule visit the [Alert Rules]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/alerting/alert_rules.md %}) page.
