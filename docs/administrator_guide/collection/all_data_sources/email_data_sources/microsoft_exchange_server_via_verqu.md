### Setup in Trace
The following sections provide the steps for installing the VerQu On-Premises Application to collect the data locally, how to use a data transfer method for moving data to RelativityOne, and how to configure the data source in Relativity Trace.

#### VerQu On-Premises Application for Data Collection

1. Navigate to the [Using VerQu]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/general_data_source_information/using_verqu.md %}) and install, configure, and schedule VerQu.

Some data source specific configuration is required while following the [Using VerQu]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/administrator_guide/collection/general_data_source_information/using_verqu.md %}) steps. That configuration can be found below.

1. Locate the **MicrosoftExchangeServer-Calendar.json** and **MicrosoftExchangeServer-Mail.json** files 
1. Use the screenshots and table below as a guide to update the values within those files.
